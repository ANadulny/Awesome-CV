\cvparagraph
Currently working as a software engineer, I am interested in exploring new challenges. I am passionate about developing, configuring and testing software. My preferred programming languages are Java and Kotlin, however I am open to learning about or utilizing any programming language. In my free time, I enjoy working on my Android application "Chicago Commutes", a Chicago public transit tracker, as well as publishing some of my source code on GitHub. I'm also a member of the Chicago Java User group. Feel free to check out my latest blog post about Clean Architecture on \href{https://medium.com/slalom-engineering/clean-architecture-with-java-11-f78bba431041}{\underline{medium}}.
